### UUID

The identification of persons in the guide is done through a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to identify the vaccinated person.

It is proposed to use [UUID version 5](https://www.uuidtools.com/uuid-versions-explained) to anonymize the national identifier of the person.

Likewise, the same technology will be used to identify cases in the event that there is more than one case per person.
